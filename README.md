# The Fractal Engine v3 - a Fractal explorer for the Atari ST
All 7,823 lines of the source code listing for the Fractal Engine 3 written in GFA BASIC 3

Many years ago I co-wrote, with Daniel Grace, a very complete Mandlebrot and Julia set explorer for the Atari ST.  
This is the source code in GFA BASIC for version 3 of the Fractal Engine, which was published in issue 42 of ST Format
magazine.

The drawing engine code was written in 68000 assembler by Dan; so this is purely the application code.

It was one of the most complete software projects I've ever done, and I'm still really proud of the program we wrote.
